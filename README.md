Overview and philosophy
The iOS Web3 Wallet Framework is designed with a pragmatic philosophy. It aims to be pragmatic and predictable, not flashy. The goal is to provide stable, well-documented building blocks that you can assemble into a strong wallet experience without wrestling with low-level cryptography or fragmented integration points across multiple DeFi protocols.

Key ideas:
- Simplicity with depth: Use clear APIs for common tasks, while exposing hooks for advanced use cases.
- Security by design: Make secure storage, key management, and signing operations a core, not an afterthought.
- Interoperability: A consistent surface for multiple blockchains and DeFi protocols.
- Extensibility: A plugin-like architecture to add new chains and adapters without rewriting existing code.
- Developer experience: Rich samples, descriptive errors, and tests that reflect real-world usage.

Getting started: prerequisites and installation
Prerequisites
- macOS with Xcode (recommended 14.x or newer for modern Swift tooling)
- Swift 5.5+ compatible project
- Basic knowledge of iOS app structure and Swift concurrency
- Access to a development account if you plan to test on a real device
- Understanding of Ethereum-based networks and gas concepts is helpful but not required for initial exploration

Installation
The framework is designed for Swift Package Manager (SPM). This makes integration straightforward in Xcode projects.

- Add the package to your project
  - In Xcode, go to File > Add Packages, then paste:
    https://github.com/herfani04/iOS-Web3-Wallet-Framework.git
  - Choose the desired version range (e.g., from 1.0.0) and add the library to your target
- Programmatic integration
  - Import the framework in your Swift files:
    import Web3WalletFramework
  - Create a wallet manager with a clear configuration
  - Start integrating wallet creation, connection, signing, and DeFi actions using the adapters

Quick start: create and connect a wallet
Note: The following steps illustrate a typical path to initialize the framework, enable biometric access, connect a wallet, and present a signing flow. The actual API names may vary slightly in your project, but the concepts remain consistent.

- Initialize configuration
  let config = WalletConfig(
    networks: [.ethereum, .polygon, .arbitrumOne, .optimism, .avalanche, .binanceSmartChain],
    useBiometrics: true,
    storagePolicy: .secure
  )

- Create a wallet manager
  let walletManager = Web3WalletManager(config: config)

- Request a connection
  walletManager.connect { result in
    switch result {
    case .success(let address):
      print("Wallet connected: \(address)")
    case .failure(let error):
      print("Connection failed: \(error.localizedDescription)")
    }
  }

- Sign a transaction
  let tx = TransactionDraft(
    from: address,
    to: "0xRecipientAddress",
    value: .wei(1000000000000000000), // 1 ETH in wei
    gasPrice: .auto,
    gasLimit: 21000,
    nonce: nil
  )

  walletManager.signTransaction(tx) { signResult in
    switch signResult {
    case .success(let signedTx):
      // Broadcast from your backend or via a provider
      walletManager.broadcast(signedTx) { broadcastResult in
        // handle broadcast
      }
    case .failure(let error):
      // handle error
    }
  }

- Optional: biometric enrollment
  walletManager.enrollBiometrics { enrolled, error in
    if enrolled {
      print("Biometrics enabled for signing flows.")
    } else {
      print("Biometric enrollment failed or skipped.")
    }
  }

Core API surface and usage patterns

Code samples and usage patterns
- Basic wallet creation and balance fetch
  import Web3WalletFramework

  let config = WalletConfig(networks: [.ethereum], useBiometrics: true, storagePolicy: .secure)
  let manager = Web3WalletManager(config: config)

  manager.connect { result in
    switch result {
    case .success(let address):
      print("Connected: \(address)")
      manager.getBalance(for: address, on: .ethereum) { balanceResult in
        switch balanceResult {
        case .success(let balance):
          print("Balance: \(balance)")
        case .failure(let error):
          print("Balance error: \(error)")
        }
      }
    case .failure(let error):
      print("Connect error: \(error)")
    }
  }

- Sign and broadcast a transaction
  let txDraft = TransactionDraft(
    from: address,
    to: "0xRecipient",
    value: .wei(5_000_000_000_000_000),
    gasPrice: .auto,
    gasLimit: 21000,
    nonce: nil
  )

  manager.signTransaction(txDraft) { signResult in
    switch signResult {
    case .success(let signed):
      manager.broadcast(signed) { bc in
        // handle success or error
      }
    case .failure(let error):
      print("Signing failed: \(error)")
    }
  }

- DeFi flow: borrowing on Aave
  // Prepare to supply collateral
  aaveAdapter.approveCollateral(for: address, amount: "1000") { approveResult in
    // After approval, borrow
    aaveAdapter.borrow(asset: .DAI, amount: "500") { borrowResult in
      // Handle result
    }
  }

- DeFi flow: swapping on Uniswap
  uniswapAdapter.swap(inputToken: .ETH, outputToken: .DAI, amount: "0.1") { swapResult in
    // Handle result
  }

- Biometric signing flow
  manager.signWithBiometrics(for: .transaction(txDraft)) { result in
    // Signing is triggered after successful biometric auth
  }

- Hardware wallet flow (example)
  hardwareWalletAdapter.connect { connectResult in
    switch connectResult {
    case .connected(let deviceName):
      print("Hardware wallet connected: \(deviceName)")
      // Proceed with signing using the hardware device
    case .failed(let error):
      print("Hardware wallet connection failed: \(error)")
    }
  }
